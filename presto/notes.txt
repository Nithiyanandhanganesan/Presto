Apache Presto is a distributed parallel query execution engine, optimized for low latency and interactive query analysis. 
Presto runs queries easily and scales without down time even from gigabytes to petabytes.

Component :
================

Client (Presto CLI) submits SQL statements to a coordinator to get the result.

Coordinator is a master daemon. The coordinator initially parses the SQL queries then analyzes and plans for the query execution. 
Scheduler performs pipeline execution, assigns work to the closest node and monitors progress.

Storage plugins are called as connectors. Hive, HBase, MySQL, Cassandra and many more act as a connector; otherwise you can also implement a custom one. 
The connector provides metadata and data for queries. The coordinator uses the connector to get metadata for building a query plan.
